        <h2>The Header</h2>
        <p>My passion and interest in IT started when I was 4 years old, my father, being an electric engineer bought our first computer, I remember how being a little boy, I was fascinating looking at this new thing with a chunky screen in black and white colour. I spend my younger years around this new thing and thanks to my father and his work we got an Internet connection by a modem in the early years of the internet when started this new technology, I still remember this horrible noise that modem did when it was connecting to the network &#128523</p>

        <h2>The Break Point</h2>
        <p>I studied Human resources at the university and I focused my career in-office staff and operational managing, I was working nearly 10 years combining office works and managing people in an export company when I realized that it was boring and monotone for me, I did not want to keep doing that all my life. So I moved to London to accomplished one of my dreams, to learn English. It was difficult at the beginning because I did not understand much English and I had to start in a lower position in the hospitality industry where my English level was not the most important but I am very grateful to all of them how gave me an opportunity and gave me the possibility of stay in London and let me improve my English and my life.</p>

        <h2>The New Beggining</h2>
        <p>My Journey in Web development began with a historical World event, The Covid19 pandemic, March of 2020 when the frighten Covid19 virus arrived and spread to most of the world. Many countries declared a lockdown being affected in many businesses and jobs everywhere. I had a stable job in an important restaurant in London and after the situation of the pandemic, the hospitality business as other industries were closed. Like other people, I found myself without a job and with an uncertain future. Instead of being depressive and frustrated with this situation, I turned my point of view and I started to see things in a positive way.</p>

        <h2>To Continue</h2>
        <p>Now with this situation in this new era of internet and mobile apps, I retook my passion for IT and this is the reason for bringing these words here to this web portfolio. I have been studying Web development for one year already, although and knowing that it will not be an easy way for me, I am trying to learn on my own with online resources, I am determined and working hard, focusing my career and future on this passionate world. I want to show in this portfolio a piece of what I have learned and I can do, and this is the first brick of what I will be capable of doing soon with a lot of work and persistency.</p>
