        <h2>My Coding history</h2>
        <p>My learning started reading two books, HTML and CSS3. I continuing practising since the summer of 2019. Even I worked every day and do not have much time, my curiosity for the Web, Websites and Mobile apps always gets me started.
          In March of 2020 when the global Covid19 pandemic begun and found myself out of work, I retook two old online courses from Google Activate, that I started years ago.
          These two courses reinforce me the curiosity about the world of  Website, and where I got more of the basics concepts of HTML5 & CSS3. At this time I did not put much attention to JavaScript or other languages, so I carried on with the HTML5 and CSS3 courses in W3schools and some small courses from Institue Of Coding and University of Leeds.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="01">Introduction to Web Development – Level 1</li>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="02">Introduction to Web Development – Level 2</li>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="03">Developing Mobile Apps</li>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="04">Computer Programming for Everyone</li>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="05">Creating a Great User Experience For Mobile Apps</li>
          <li class="certificateLink" id="06">Introduction To Coding And Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After those courses, I found myself a bit lost without any idea or guidance of the next step. Looking for new online resources I found Codecademy.com , At this time and with the pandemic, they gave me four-month free membership access to all their courses witch helped me a lot and gave me my motivation back. I made some small courses from there and I started the Full Stack Web Development Career Path. This Course became a bit of a surprise for me, I was thinking that HTML and CSS were the most important languages about websites, and this course opened my mind to a new wide world of animations, interactivity, possibilities, and resources.  This course was the most complete that I did and taught me a lot of new things, the importance of JavaScript and his libraries ( Lodash, JQuery, Node.js, React, Express, Mocha),  SQL, Git, Wordpress. It helped me to change my vision of Web development and having a strong knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 because all the courses that I did before were about those subjects, I decided to focus my learning more on Java Scrip and his libraries.
          After I finished this course I choose to get more specific with Frond-End Web Development although without forgetting the Back-End side. At the moment I am doing the Frond-End Engineer Career Path by Codecademy (77% completed)  trying of getting more knowledge of Java-Script and his Libraries.
        </p>

          <li class="certificateLink" id="07">Full Stack Web Development Career Path</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In my future learning, after I finish this path, I would like to start a new language like Python and be focus on JavaScript and  React, which attract me a lot and I thinking that it could be the present and future for the new generation of Web Development.
          While I am continually studying and learning I would love to collaborate in any project or start working in this industry as a Junior Front-End Web developer, Junior Web developer, or even as Web developer apprenticeships, It would be nice to have a guide-line and put my skills and knowledge in exciting new projects and get the experience and knowledge of professionals of this industry.
